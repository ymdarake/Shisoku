Before committing: ensure tests pass (npm run test), run coverage if needed, and check lints (TS build). Use selective staging (git add <files>) not git add .
Commit message: start with gitmoji, concise JP subject, then details.
After commit: push to origin main and verify CI/preview if applicable.
